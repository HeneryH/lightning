## 5.0.0-alpha2
* Ported the `lightning:subprofile` Drupal Console command to Drush. To generate a sub-profile,
  run `drush generate lightning-subprofile`.
* Removed the `lightning:version` command. It is no longer needed because Lightning natively uses
  semantic versioning as of Lightning 5.0.0-alpha1.
